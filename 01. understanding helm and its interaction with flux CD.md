Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that simplifies the deployment and management of applications.
Helm uses charts, which are packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources, to define, install, and upgrade complex Kubernetes applications.

Flux CD, on the other hand, is a **GitOps operator** for Kubernetes that helps in the continuous delivery and automated deployment of applications. 
It monitors a Git repository for changes and automatically applies those changes to the Kubernetes cluster.

When Helm and Flux CD are used together, it's often referred to as "GitOps with Helm." Here's an overview of how Helm interacts with Flux CD in a typical GitOps workflow:

### 1. Helm Charts in Git Repository:
Helm charts are stored in a Git repository along with other Kubernetes manifests.

### 2. Flux CD Watches the Git Repository:
Flux CD is configured to watch a specific Git repository and a specific path within that repository. It continuously polls the repository for changes.

### 3. HelmRelease Custom Resources:
Flux CD uses custom resources called HelmRelease to define Helm charts and their configurations. These resources are typically stored in the same Git repository.

### 4. GitOps Workflow:
Changes to the Helm charts or HelmRelease resources are made through Git commits and pushes. This follows the GitOps workflow, where all changes are version-controlled and auditable.

### 5. Flux CD Reconciliation:
When changes are pushed to the Git repository, Flux CD detects these changes during its regular reconciliation loop.

### 6. Helm Operator in Flux CD:
Flux CD has an embedded Helm Operator that understands HelmRelease resources. When Flux CD detects changes, it uses Helm Operator to apply those changes to the cluster.

### 7. Helm Commands Executed by Flux CD:
Helm Operator executes Helm commands (e.g., helm upgrade, helm install) based on the HelmRelease configurations.

### 8. Automated Deployments:
Flux CD automates the deployment of Helm charts to the Kubernetes cluster. It ensures that the deployed state matches the desired state defined in the HelmRelease resources.

### 9. Observability and Rollback:
Flux CD provides observability into the deployment process. If there are issues, it's possible to roll back to a previous known-good state using Git.

### 10. Security and Compliance:
GitOps with Helm and Flux CD supports security and compliance by enforcing changes through a version-controlled process, ensuring that all changes are traceable, auditable, and reproducible.

By using Flux CD and Helm together, organizations can achieve automated, Git-centric continuous delivery for Kubernetes applications. 
This approach brings clarity, traceability, and reliability to the deployment process.
